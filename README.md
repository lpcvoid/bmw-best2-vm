# bmw-best2-vm
A Virtual Machine implementation capable of executing BMW's proprietary BEST2 instruction set.

This was deprecated by my rewrite in C++, which is way more feature complete: https://github.com/lpcvoid/bmw-better-vm

# Intro

I wrote this in order to execute jobs that are located in BMW's *.prg files. These jobs are actually programs compiled in BMW's own proprietary instruction set, called BEST2, which is a word game for "BEschreibungssprache für STeuergeräte", or "description language for ECUs" in English. The goal of this project was to create an environment which could run these jobs, in order to be independant from BMW's own software tools, namely EDIABAS.

# So how does it work?

I'll soon commit a sample application which shows how to execute jobs. Please note that this VM is far from done, as very many features of the BEST2 language specification are still missing. It is uncertain if i'll ever finish it completly. Feel free to attempt for yourself.

# What works already?

Simply put, every job that doesn't actually send data to the car works pretty well. Basics such as arithmetic operations, shifts and copy opcodes are implemented, and should work fine with all types of operands. For example, the IDENT jobs work nicely, as do most of the INIT and "LESEN_*" jobs. For everything else, you'll need to implement the missing opcodes. The VM tells you if it runs into one which isn't implemented yet.

# Can I use it in a project of mine?

Sure, if you want. Just do me a favor and attribute me somewhere. 

# Why Delphi?

Dunno. It was my favourite language back when I started this. Nowadays, i'd probably write it in C++ or something.
